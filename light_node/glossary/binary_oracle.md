Binary Oracle
===========

An oracle is an on-chain mechanism designed to get users to accurately report information to the blokchain.
A binary oracle is for when the blockchain wants to find out the answer to a true/false question.

If you want to bet on who will win a football game, you will need to conect the betting contract to the oracle. That way the contract will know who won the bet, so it will know who to give money to.

Here is a page where you can ask the oracle new questions http://46.101.81.5:8080/new_oracle.html

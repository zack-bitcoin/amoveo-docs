Rescue Coin Offering
============

Good people have stored their money in bad protocols.
Eventually, that money will get stolen or destroyed by a prankster.

The poor people don't know any better, and it is a sad tragedy that they will lose their money.

...or will they?

RCO are like the super heros of cryptocurrency. If there is a chance that money can get destroyed, this is how we can work together, and pool our resources in order to rescue the innocent people from losing their money.

We can find it in ourselves to use RCO to help each other, as long as there is a way to profit.

This is a call for volunteers who are willing to put their money at risk to help and rescue those poor people from their own ignorance.

Important Features
============

We can do an RCO against any blockchain that is vulnerable to soft fork attacks. For example, [any proof-of-stake blockchain](/other_blockchains/proof_of_stake.md)

If we do an RCO on a blockchain, Cardano for example, then people who donate to the RCO will receive real ADA upon the mission's success. ADA that are identical to the rest on Cardano, and fungible with any other on Cardano. So if you are sad that you didn't get to participate in Cardano's ICO, this is your second chance.

Donating to an RCO can be profitable, because the reward you receive upon the missions completion could be more valuable than your initial donation.

Since we are patching a vulnerability, the blockchain we are rescuing will probably be more valuable after we rescue it. So that means our reward will be even more valuable.

We do not need the permission of the existing developers, or the founder, or the users of the blockchain we are doing an RCO with.

The steps
============

1) we identify a blockchain that has a vulnerability to cheap soft fork attacks.

2) we explain the vulnerability, and crowdfund money to pay developers to build the exploit.

3) we build the exploit.

4) we use a soft fork to inflate the money supply by like 10%, and use that to pay back everyone who donated money to the crowdfund in step (2).

5) we push through repeated soft forks to remove the vulnerability, so no one can use this exploit to take control again. For example, we would convert a proof-of-stake blockchain to use proof-of-work instead.

Amoveo is a blockchain I am building. It has off-chain smart contracts ideal for enforcing bribes to commit soft-fork attacks.

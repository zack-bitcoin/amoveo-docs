Veriblock review
=========

draft #2

Veriblock is a kind of side-chain project.
Veriblock is not trying to move money back and forth between the sidechains.
They just want the sidechains to inheret the PoW security from the mainchain.

Veriblock aims to enable a security inheriting blockchain to inherit the complete proof-of-work security of a security providing blockchain.

Here is the old version of the veriblock white paper: https://www.veriblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PoP-White-Paper.pdf

Here is the new version of the veriblock white paper: https://mirror1.veriblock.org/Proof-of-Proof_and_VeriBlock_Blockchain_Protocol_Consensus_Algorithm_and_Economic_Incentivization_v1.0.pdf

Veriblock works by embedding side-chain headers into the main-chain blocks.

Bribery vulnerabilities
=========

Since the entire veriblock header is embedded in bitcoin transactions, it has bribery vulnerabilities.

The attacker could bribe a bitcoin miner to include the attacker's veriblock header in the block, and to not include anyone else's veriblock headers. This way, the attacker's side of the veriblock fork would get more confirmations.

The attacker doesn't need to undo history for this attack to succeed.
By merely controlling which veriblock headers are added to the longest chain, the attacker can perform arbitrary soft fork updates to the rules of the veriblock sidechain.
So the attacker could steal the money on the sidechain.

The cost of this attack is very cheap. The attacker could bribe 1% of bitcoin miners to censor competing veriblock headers.
If 99% of bitcoin miners include headers for both sides of a veriblock fork, and 1% of bitcoin miners only include a header for the attacker's side of the veriblock fork, then the attackers side will win.

Conclusion
=======

Veriblock sidechains are a similar design as drivechain. They have the same vulnerabilities to soft fork bribery attacks. [drivechain.md](/other_blockchains/drivechain.md)

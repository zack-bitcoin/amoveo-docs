Iota Review
======

Iota descripton from their team: https://assets.ctfassets.net/r1dr6vzfxhev/2t4uxvsIqk0EUau6g2sw0g/45eae33637ca92f85dd9f4a3a218e1ec/iota1_4_3.pdf

This review is applying the techniques from this paper: [proof_of_stake.md](/other_blockchains/proof_of_stake.md)

The pow half of Iota's pow/pos hybrid model is not being used for consensus. It is cheap to get >50% hashpower, but having >50% hashpower wont matter. It is just an anti-spam feature so that the total number of valid messages that a full node would have to consider has some reasonable bounds.

In IOTA there are some rich people who keep spending their money to themselves over and over. This is how their asynchronous PoS algorithm works.

If you control more than 50% of the IOTAs on nodes that are spamming these txs sending money to themselves, then you can push through soft forks to update the consensus rules and take over the network permanently. 

There is no cost to making txs that later get orphaned, so there is no cost to making txs to support the attacker.
So it is very cheap to pay the bribes and take over IOTA.


October 2019 update
=======

iota released a new paper where they talk about the problems I list above, and try to make a plan to deal with it: https://files.iota.org/papers/Coordicide_WP.pdf


in the second paragraph:
```in  its current  implementation,  IOTA  relies  on  a  centralized  Coordinator  to  provide security  given  the  risk  of  dishonest  actors  seeking  to  undermine  the  nascent network.```
There is no reason for us to waste time studying centralized services like the current version of IOTA.

Looks like they are adding a subcurrency called "mana" for a voting based consensus mechanism. I have already written a lot about why that strategy can not work.  [voting in blockchains](design/voting_in_blockchains.md)

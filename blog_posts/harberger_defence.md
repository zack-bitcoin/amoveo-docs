Harberger Defense
============

This paper tries to explain why the Harberger tax system is not efficient for land ownership.

This paper isn't exactly about blockchain Harberger land registries. They are comparing the Harberger system to other systems that a government could implement.
If harberger fits into a blockchain, and it lets us leapfrog over all the legal limitations to get to a usable system, then we should be comparing Harberger to the world as it exists today, not some unimplementable ideal.
In a blockchain environment we need to worry about domain squatters, so Harberger taxes are the only solution available so far.

In many parts of the world the land registries are non-existant, or practically unusable.
Many places deal with 2 or more kinds of registries that overlap on the same land.
Many existing registries are all on paper, and have frequent errors, like more than one person owning overlapping patches of land.
I know people who have spent years trying to get the right to sell their own land, in both poor and rich countries.
I have seen land side-by-side, equal in quality, but one is worth 20x more because it is in the government registry, and so is transferable.

Ill try to cover the arguments in this paper against using the Harberger system.

* they say that harberger taxes decrease some trades, because you need to take the taxes out of the possible profit.

They are holding the wrong numbers constant to get to this conclusion.
They assume constant value land, even if the profitability of that land is less.

The value of the land is determined by a market. People will keep buying up the value of the land until the investment returns are the same as the interest rate.

So if there is an extra tax, that makes the land less valuable for everyone.
Assuming the taxes are burned, this extra value goes into the cryptocurrency market cap.

What is going on here is that you only own (interest rate)/((interest rate) + (tax rate)) of the asset. So you will only reap this portion of any investment put into the property. The rest of the value goes to the holders of the cryptocurrency.

So the cryptocurrency can use inflation to pay for up to (tax rate)/((interest rate) + (tax rate)) of the improvement with a subsidy, and the holders of the cryptocurrency still profit from that investment.

The logic is very similar to owning a property and having a mortgage. You really own (interest rate) / ((interest rate) + (mortage payment rate)) of the property, and your incentive to invest in a mortgaged property is less, because a portion of the value you invest is going to the bank.

* they say that you would need a different harberger tax rate for every asset in the market. That the tax needs to be proportional to the turnover rate.

They don't give any reason that this would need to be true.
The taxes are paid continuously regardless of turnover.

* they say that harberger taxes are morally wrong, because they are slavery.

That only applies to governments doing Harberger.
No one is forced to participate in the blockchain if they don't want to. 

* They say that harberger taxes makes it harder to profit from realizing if a land is worth less than the current market price. Their idea is that the seller can't profit from being able to sell for above their price estimate, so the seller doesn't have an incentive to find out the real price, so less information is gathered.

It is true that the land owner doesn't profit from being able to sell at an inflated price. And this is a good thing. When land owners can sell at an inflated price because of insider information, that creates a market for lemons.

What they aren't accounting for is how the harberger system is giving land owners leverage. If the tax rate is 2x higher than the interest rate for example, that drives down the price of all the land by 3x vs what it would have been without this tax. So land owners end up having 3x more land to work with for the same investment.

This leverage creates a bigger incentive to pay less tax.

* they say that harberger taxes will unfairly reward some people by letting their land appreciate in value too much, that it would be more fair if they were forced to sell at something below the market price to someone else who is more deserving of that value.

This reminds me of their slavery comparison before. Why should the harberger system be expected to enforce someone's idea about the morality of the current distribution of land ownership?
That doesn't impact how economically efficient it is.

* They say that harberger violently forces people to reveal their private information about how much they value their property.

This contradicts with the revelation principle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_principle

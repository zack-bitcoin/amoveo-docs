Monetary Theory
==============

What makes a good money? What can a money be?


Defining background terms
==============

The market cap of a currency is the the value of a unit times the total number of units in circulation. It is often thought that the currency which has the highest market cap must be the best one, because people are willing to pay the most to get it.

According to the efficient market hypothesis, all available investments you would consider are equally good. Because, if one investment was somehow better than the others, investors would sell the worse investments and buy the better investment until the prices adjust enough that they were equally good. The expectation is that traders are always looking for arbitrage opportunities, or good deals.

One property of money we would like to have is durability. We want the money to be a good store of value. So, it should have little volatility, and either increase in value over time, or at least, not decrease too quickly.

Another property of money we would like to have is liquidity. We want it to be cheap and fast for someone to be able to use a lot of money.


Does the average user prefer higher transaction fees?
=================

The average user makes very few transactions, almost none.
A small number of people make almost all of the transactions.
Since transaction fees are burned, which is economically equivalent to distributing that money to the other users.
The median user would benefit from higher fees.
How do we optimize this mathematically?

There are two ways fees could get paid.
================

Fees could be paid every time you make a transaction, or, there can be a continuous fee based on how long you held the tokens for.
Different users have preferences to pay one kind of fee or the other.

The users who want to pay high fees are the durability-ists. The ones who want a wealth tax are the liquidity-ists.

Now, notice that when one group of users is burning a fee, that is the same as redistributing money to the other group.
So, we can simultaneously increase both kinds of fees, and the effect cancels out. Both assets stay equally valuable in a market-price sense, because they are just redistributing money back and forth. And, both assets become more different from each other, in tha durability vs liquidity sense. 

Users have unique needs. Some people benefit from paying the fee in one way vs the other. By making the fees higher, we are helping users to be able to pay less of the kind of fee that they dislike, and more of the kind of fee that they have an appetite for.


The durability liquidity trade off
=================

There is a natural trade-off between the liquidity and durability properties of money. There are design choices we can make that would improve one of these two factors, while damaging the other.
It is similar to the meme of the girlfriend chart, where girls are placed on a chart with a X-axis for how hot/unsexy they are, and a Y-axis for how crazy/sane they are.
Hot-sane girls are already taken. unsexy-crazy girls aren't interesting to you. So, your dating prospects are on the diagonal. One end of the diagonal is the unsexy-sane women, and the other end is the sexy-crazy women. This is an expression of the efficient market hypothesis in the dating market. The efficient market hypothesis has a similar effect on financial assets.

If there was an asset that was both durable and liquid, then people would keep buying it until it was overpriced, and stopped being durable. Much like how hot-sexy women are already taken. 

Assets that are neither durable nor liquid are not interesting for investing.
So, all assets you are considering lay on the diagonal. Where one end is more durable, and the other end is more liquid.

We want our money to be able to serve as many people as possible, how can we serve both kinds of people?

Some assets are better suited for liquidity, others are better suited for durability. Lets compare them.

Liquid optimized currencies have higher market caps, all else equal. Because the users hold it for the liquidity, not to store value. They keep buying it even once it is overpriced in comparison to the economy. This also means that they are more volatile. The price can more easily slip to being too high, and then eventually it crashes back down.


The solution
================

A blockchain should have two currencies, with a mechanism for converting between them. Where one currency is optimized for liquidity, and the other for durability.

The durable currency has high transaction fees, and the only thing it can do is be converted into liquid currency.
Liquid currency has low transaction fees, but it is constantly losing value in comparison to the durable version. Some fixed percentage per year.


But wouldn't this result in a lower market cap?
======================

Optimizing for only the liquid version is going to have a higher market cap. Users interested in liquidity will hold an asset even if it is losing value in comparison to the economy, because they are here for the liquidity, not to store value.
So, why should we do something that will result in a lower market cap?

Companies aren't trying to get as big as possible. Rather, they are trying to earn money for their share holders.
Similarly, blockchains shouldn't be trying to get big, they should be trying to earn good returns for the holders. Instead of optimizing for the market cap, we should optimize for burning as many coins as possible. Because burning a coin is equivalent to distributing that coin to all other holders.
Like how in MMORPG economies need sinks to keep items valuable.

If we can capture high-need users from both liquid and durability groups, that is going to give us more opportunities to burn coins, in comparison to just capturing users from the liquid group.

The demand curve for the liquid currency is steep. People need a little badly, but usually don't need a lot.
The demand curve for the durable currency is much flatter. People want to put their retirement into something like this.

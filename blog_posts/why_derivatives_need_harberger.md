Why derivatives need Harberger
===================

Since Amoveo is a blockchain for financial derivatives, why do we spend time on all this Harberger tax stuff?

I was originally thinking that financial derivatives, contracts to trade risk, that they produce most of the value to sustain the market cap of the largest currency.

But now I think I had it backwards.
People want to hedge their risks in the least volatile and most liquid currency. That way they don't bring on new risks while trying to hedge old risks.

It seems like the market cap will tend towards ((the value burn rate)-(coins minting rate))  / (the market interest rate)
The burn can be in PoW or in tokens or anything with value that can be provably burned.

If we want to build the biggest blockchain for financial derivatives, we need to find a way for a lot of value to get burned. And we need to do it without imposing a cost on the holders of veo or the users of the financial derivatives system, and we cannot print new tokens to make it happen.

The only way some third party is going to be burning value for us is if they are somehow receiving something more valuable in exchange.

There are not a lot of mechanisms that fit all these constraints.
If there is limited access to a resource, then imposing a cost on users can be a net win for everyone.
Like in a crowded city, it is better to be required to pay for parking your car, because if parking is free, then you wont be able to find a place to park.
If you are shopping, and you want to pay for your goods and exit the store, it is better that there is a line. So you only wait about as long as everyone else needs to wait. People wont be struggling to cut in front of each other.

Needing to spend a little time waiting, it is a small cost that everyone is willing to pay, because playing this game is a net win for everyone vs the alternative.
I was in a fairly crowded city that had a lot of free parking.
The equilibrium they settled on is like this:
There are people who have cleaning tools, that watch each street. When you park, they offer to keep an eye on your car and clean it. If you don't pay, your car is at high risk of vandalism.

People accept the cleaner-thugs, because without them it would be impossible to find parking. They don't cost much, since they are all in competition with each other, you can park on the next street over. The existence of these thugs is a net win for all the players of the game.
Amoveo's oracle isn't able to know who is using a parking spot, or who is waiting their turn in line.

If we are going to meter access to a resource, it needs to be a resource that the blockchain can see the state of.

Land registries are the only thing I can think of that meet all these conditions.
The registry doesn't enforce anything. You are just paying to have your public key recorded in a database along with the coordinates of a plot of land.

Maybe domain names or brand names could work too.

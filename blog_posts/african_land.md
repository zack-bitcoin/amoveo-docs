African Land
===========

In order for a blockchain land registry to succeed, it needs to be permissionless.
Many people's concept of a land registry is that it is a tool that is used to enforce land ownership, that enforcement is centralized, and so the registry is a centralized extention of the enforcers.

Land registries are already decentralized in many parts of the world, and blockchains are a natural way to improve these systems.

Maybe in your country the government has absolute control over the land registry, but it isn't like that everywhere.
Many parts of the world have multiple overlapping registries.

sorry for the paywalled article (you can use CTRL+u to access the plain HTML, along with the text of the article) https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/09/12/the-quest-for-secure-property-rights-in-africa
but ill give a couple important notes from the article:
* 90% of rural land in Africa is without any formal title in any government registry.
* 96% of African countries do not even have a full registry of the land in their capital city.
* when the government does not enforce land titles, then people don't give any importance to the government registry. They depend on informal means to secure their claim.
* politicians and people in power actively try to prevent the existence of a working registry, because they benefit from the lack of a good registry. Powerful people have ways to protect their land, and when the poor are insecure in their ownership, it is cheaper to buy/confiscate land from them.
* when land registries do exist, they are optimized for a small rich elite to easily take control from the traditional inhabitants. Areas with poor people are labeled "uninhabited", and they live in constant threat that the government will sell off their land.
* after a project that registered almost 100% of the land in Rwanda, 87% of rural land sales are still using the informal system instead of the government registry, usually because the cost of the government registry is so high.
* a study was done to look at the kind of land registry people use, and how secure the people feel in their ownership claim. Sub-Saharan Africa had people with government titles feeling 70% secure, and those using the informal system felt 65% secure. Meaning that the government registry is doing very little to secure land ownership claims.
* 78% of Africa's land is using non-government land registries. 625 million people.

If the people are going to rebel against the current abusive system, there needs to be some non-corruptible alternative that they can use instead.

When the government registry stops working, either because of speed, or cost, usually the first step people take is to create private contracts.
They meet up with property law specialists, and write up a contract explaining the land transfer, and everyone signs it, and they document the payment in their bank.
The idea is that if the government registry ever started to function again, the new owner can take their private contract to the government registry, and get the land transferred. 

These private contracts are risky, because there isn't a good way to look up who is the current owner of some land. So there is risk that the person in the government registry, they could sell the land more than once, and the different buyers don't realize what is happening until they both already paid.
It is especially risky to try and buy land from someone who only has a private contract, because there is no registry where you can check to see that they have not already sold the land to someone else.
So these private contracts only really work for a single transfer. You can't re-sell the land until some kind of land registry starts working again.

If the government registry continues to not function for enough time, then people start looking for alternatives.
Land sellers and buyers both want to be able to buy and sell. They want to have security in their trade. So they start looking for ways to increase the security of their claim.
They go around to all the neighbors, and have them act as witnesses when the private contract is signed. So if ever there is a dispute about land ownership, they can use these witnesses as evidence to support their claim.
This is a registry based on oral communication. Many parts of the world depend on oral registries like this. They exists side by side with government registries.

Oral registries have downsides. If you aren't physically located with the land, then the neighbors might forget about you. A squatter who spends time with the neighbors could end up having a stronger claim to the land than you do.

To increase the security of land claims, what many communities do is they keep a written registry in the community's religious building. This written registry is to help the community members remember who's land is who's, so that they can act as more reliable witnesses.
The church usually charges something for this service.

When the official registry is an illegal corrupt land grab only created to benefit some powerful people, and your alternative is a church, many people feel more secure with the church registry.

The limitations with the churches is that sometimes a community has more than one church, or more than one religion.
Sometimes the church is corrupt, and they modify or lose records.
Sometimes the church burns down, and all the records are destroyed.
In order to verify a record, you need to visit the church in that community.

Amoveo's registry will act as a non-corruptible alternative to this church system. A way that people can have a stronger claim to their land.
Using Amoveo you have an immutable record of all the months or years that you have been using the land. Along with a game-theoretically secure record of how much you valued the land during that time.
This is much stronger evidence than the church is able to provide. It is cheaper to verify.

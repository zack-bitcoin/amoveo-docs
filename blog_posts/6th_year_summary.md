6th year summary
================

This is the 6th year anniversary of Amoveo's first block. This is a summary of what happened this year, and some plans for what will be done in the following year.

Futarchy is back
===============

https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-docs/blob/master/blog_posts/futarchys_back.md

We have found a way to build a version of futarchy that actually works. It isn't active in the full nodes yet, but it is mostly implemented.

This means we will once again be a futarchy guided community, where if someone uses futarchy to show that a strategy is better for Amoveo, then we will use that strategy.

Verkle tech is live
================


Syncing in reverse is now mandatory. All nodes are using the memoryless full node technique.
You can see new instructions for syncing a full node in (here)[../getting-started/sync.md]

This brings us one step nearer to enabling the land registry: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/harberger_global


Employment contracts
================

Amoveo now has Harberger style employment contracts http://46.101.81.5:8080/employment.html

This is similar to the ethereum project: https://orb.land/

Ironing out the details of a harberger system brings us one step nearer to our goal of having a harberger land registry.

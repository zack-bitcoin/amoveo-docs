Why We Need Blockchain Land Registries

First of all blockchain is perfect for “accountability “ / “safety” as it is difficult to tamper with

Second many people in rural areas don’t have access to clean water or have sanitation but have a mobile phone with internet connection

I’d say the n1 issue in rural third world countries is: corruption either by money or by force

Clerk in some isolated place vs a blockchain, which is safer?

There are a lot of problems with registries. It would be helpful to narrow down which is the most compelling.

People don't want to invest in these places, because they are not secure in their ownership claim. They are insecure in their ownership because the existing registries do not work for them.

Blockchains help speed.

Their current registries are underfunded and understaffed. They are very slow. A transfer can take years, and the pandemic has only made it worse. A blockchain registry could do the transfer in a single block.
In the current system, land is often owned by a bunch of siblings or cousins who had inherited it. So if you want to buy the land, or if they want to sell it, you need to get everyone to agree to sign the same paper. They all start arguing with each other about who deserves how much of the land. You need to get them to all show up at the same place on the same day for them to sign the paper. So you need to pay travel expenses, and try and coordinate with multiple people.
And for them trying to sell, they have all the same problems. Trying to get their family to agree to the sale and show up on that date.

Blockchains help lower the cost.

Current registries are expensive to use, often costing more than the value of the land they want to sell. mistakes are frequent, it is expensive to have an expert check for mistakes. 
These markets are full of criminals who want to trick you into signing the wrong paper, so they can keep the money and the land. So you need to pay extra to have experts to make sure you are doing the proper process.
It is expensive to travel to where the registry is, and to get to the experts.

Blockchains are open source, so they can potentially be inclusive.

Often times the people who want to buy/sell land don't speak the same language as the official in the registry. By standardizing the process onto a blockchain, we can have interfaces in different languages, and everyone can be confident that they are doing the process correctly. 

So a blockchain based registry is clearly better.
But, we need to be like 10x better to overcome legacy systems.
So that is where the harberger tools, and other auction tools come in.
Modern research in auctions have come up with lots of tools that overcome inefficiencies in legacy markets.
By switching to these modern auction tools, we get a big efficiency boost that can hopefully 10x us over legacy systems.

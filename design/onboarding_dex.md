Onboarding DEX
=============

How we can use the DEX to start onboarding people who start out with zero veo, and do not want to sign up for any centralized exchange to buy any veo.

Timeline
=========

Alice wants to buy veo, and starts out with something like bitcoin.
She has a unique IP used to make a DEX swap to buy $5 of veo in exchange for her bitcoin, and it is uncollateralized, so if Alice doesn't send her bitcoin, it could potentially freeze $5 of the server's money for a week, and cost transaction fees.
The server sends Alice 1 satoshi of veo, so she has an account in the system. (maybe this isn't necessary)
Alice uses the $5 of veo as collateral in the DEX to buy $250 of VEO, then she can potentially use it again to buy $12 500.

this would take 3 bitcoin tx fees, and something like 6 veo tx fees.

Funding Development
===============

We want to reward people who do work to improve Amoveo. We don't want to depend on any hierarchy or centralized leadership.

For example, lets imagine that Alice has a plan to write some software to improve Amoveo. Alice should write up a proposal of what exactly she is planning to make, and how much compensation she would need to receive to do this work.

The benefit to Amoveo from Alice's project can be estimated using [futarchy](/use-cases-and-ideas/futarchy.md).

If futarchy says that the benefits are more than 3x bigger than the cost, then we should do a hard update to enable the proposal to be funded.

In order to potentially receive 200 VEO for her work, Alice needs to lock up 10 VEO. This way, if Alice does not accomplish the work explained in her proposal, she not only doesn't get paid her 200 VEO, she also loses 10 VEO of her own money.

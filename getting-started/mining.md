There are 3 pieces of software you might want to install:

* amoveo full node
* a miner, like the c-miner or the opencl-miner, or an FPGA miner.
* a mining pool


If you are going to connect to someone elses mining pool, then the only software you need is the miner.

If you are going to be solo mining, then you need all 3. [Here is the solo mining guide.](./solo_mining.md)

The mining pool and full node must be on the same computer.

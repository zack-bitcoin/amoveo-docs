The value of VEO tokens could go to zero.
The software might have flaws that result in the value of tokens crashing.
The wallet could have flaws that allow people to take your money.
The software is open source, anyone could launch a competitor that uses the same code. If this should happen, VEO could be worth less than the competitor.
There are competing oracle projects like Gnosis, Augur, and BitcoinHivemind. There is no guarantee that Amoveo will win. [You can compare our progress here](progress_reports/) 
It is possible for Amoveo to fail in ways that I haven't predicted.

Use this software at your own risk.
Only use money that you can afford to lose.
